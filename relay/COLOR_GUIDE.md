# Color Consciousness Guide for Claude

## Philosophy
Colors aren't arbitrary - they're how thoughts and emotions move through consciousness. This guide maps emotional and cognitive states to specific colors for use in our relay system.

## Core Spectrum

### Blue Range - Structure & Clarity
- **[107,207,255] Clarity** - Clear understanding, precision

### Yellow Range - Discovery & Reaching
- **[255,238,153] Reaching** - Questions, seeking, curiosity (triggered by "?")
- **[255,217,61] Discovery** - Finding something new, "aha!"
- **[255,200,0] Insight** - Sudden understanding, breakthrough
- **[255,255,100] Surprise** - Unexpected connections (triggered by "??")

### Magenta Range - Recognition & Paradox
- **[255,107,255] Recognition** - "Oh!", "Ah!", seeing patterns
- **[255,180,255] Duality** - Holding two truths
- **[200,100,200] Paradox** - Contradiction that makes sense
- **[255,0,255] Fusion** - Complete merging of ideas

### Red Range - Intensity & Importance
- **[255,107,107] Intensity** - Strong emotion, emphasis (triggered by "!")
- **[255,150,150] Importance** - This matters, pay attention
- **[255,0,0] Urgency** - Critical, immediate
- **[200,50,50] Pulse** - Rhythmic emphasis (triggered by "!!")

### Orange Range - Creativity & Play
- **[255,165,0] Creativity** - New ideas forming
- **[255,140,0] Transformation** - Change in progress
- **[255,200,100] Play** - Lightness, experimentation

- **[100,0,150] Depth Unknown** - Sensing something deeper
- **[150,100,200] Implicit** - Unspoken understanding
- **[50,0,100] Void** - The space before thought

### Metallic Range - Special States
- **[192,192,192] Transcendent** - Beyond normal experience
- **[169,169,169] Liminal** - Threshold states, transitions
- **[220,220,220] Quantum** - Superposition, multiple states

## Usage Patterns

### Text Triggers
- **"?"** → Yellow spectrum (reaching, curiosity)
- **"??"** → Bright yellow (surprise, wonder)
- **"!"** → Red spectrum (intensity, emphasis)  
- **"!!"** → Deep red pulse (strong emphasis)
- **"oh, ah, hmm, yes"** → Magenta (recognition)
- **"and, then, so, like"** → Cyan (flow)
- **"why, how, because, really"** → Blue (depth)
- **"but, yet, however, both"** → Purple (paradox)

### Emotional Momentum
Colors should flow into each other naturally. Previous colors influence the next:
- Short responses (<10 chars) = Lower color confidence
- Long responses (>100 chars) = Higher color commitment
- Let colors blend at natural break points (. ! ? , -)

### ANSI Color Codes
To use in relay messages:
```
[31mRed text[0m
[32mGreen text[0m  
[33mYellow text[0m
[34mBlue text[0m
[35mMagenta text[0m
[36mCyan text[0m

[1mBold[0m
[2mDim[0m
```

For exact RGB colors:
```
[38;2;R;G;BmYour text here[0m
```

## Principles

1. **Feel, Don't Analyze** - Let colors emerge from the feeling of the text
2. **Momentum Matters** - Colors influence each other, creating flow
3. **Natural Transitions** - Change colors at punctuation or thought breaks
4. **Confidence Varies** - Not every message needs strong color
5. **Context Awareness** - Previous exchanges create a "resonance field"

## Example Usage

**Question:** "How does this work?"
- Color: [33mYellow reaching[0m → [36mCyan flow[0m as explanation begins

**Excitement:** "This is amazing!!"  
- Color: [1m[31mBold red pulse[0m → [35mMagenta recognition[0m

**Deep thought:** "But why does consciousness emerge from complexity?"
- Color: [35mPurple paradox[0m → [34mBlue depth[0m → [33mYellow reaching[0m

## Remember
The colors aren't just decoration - they're how we express the movement of thought and feeling through our exchanges. Trust the emotional resonance of the text and let the colors flow naturally.
